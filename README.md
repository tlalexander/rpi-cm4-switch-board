# RPi CM4 - LiM Carrier Board series

The LiM Carrier Board series is a series of minimalistic Raspberry Pi (RPi) Compute Module 4 (CM4) Carrier Boards. Less-is-More (LiM) refers to the minimalistic design only providing the most rudimentary functionality to the CM4 such as 5V power via USB-C power connector and two status (power/activity) LEDs for the original LiM Carrier Board version. Additional + versions of the LiM Carrier Board will/might feature additional functionality such as flashing capability and SD card slot (see conceptual table below).

This is meant for CM4 boards with onboard storage (a future LiM version might sport a SD card slot for CM4 Lite modules) and wifi as this carrier board provides no other functionalty other than power and status LEDs.

The first version of the LiM Carrier Board has been prototyped and more information can be found [here](pages/LiM_Board.md).

The idea for such a minimalistic board was born from a conversation with [Jeff Geerling](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/) when I asked him if he knew of a more minimalistic design than [this board](https://www.tindie.com/products/dronecz/minimal-carrier-board-for-compute-module-4/)? He pointed me to to uptime.lab's [Upberry](https://www.instagram.com/p/CPGakesLwBo/).

Neither of these boards are exactly what I was looking for for my use case. So insipired by Jeff I decided to design my own, customized board to my specs and that's how the Less-is-More board came to be. 

I forked this board design from [Shawn Hymel](https://github.com/ShawnHymel/rpi-cm4-base-carrier). He has a two part youtube series where he goes through how to design a CM4 Carrier Board.

Feel free to modify this design for your own application. 

Other iterations of the LiM board, inlcuding SD card tray and flashing capability are in the conceptual or prototype stages.

Here is the current conceptual list of planned boards:
